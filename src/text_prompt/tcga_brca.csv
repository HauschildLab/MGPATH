"A whole slide image of Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma shows an invasive growth pattern with irregular, ill-defined borders and dense fibrous stroma at low resolution, and reveals nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromatic nuclei, and high mitotic activity at high resolution."
"A whole slide image of Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma displays a diffuse, single-file infiltration pattern with minimal fibrous stroma at low resolution, and reveals uniform, small nuclei with minimal pleomorphism and single-file cell arrangements at high resolution."
