"Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) exhibits distinct visual features on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images at both low and high resolutions. At low resolution, LUAD typically presents as irregular, heterogeneous regions with varying texture and color intensity compared to normal lung tissue. The tumor areas may appear denser and more disorganized, often with a loss of the normal alveolar structure. At high resolution, LUAD is characterized by glandular structures or acinar patterns, where malignant cells form gland-like formations. These cells often have enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei with irregular shapes and prominent nucleoli. The cytoplasm may appear eosinophilic, and mitotic figures can frequently be observed, indicating active cell division. Additionally, there may be evidence of stromal invasion, where tumor cells infiltrate the surrounding tissue, and desmoplastic reactions, characterized by fibrous stroma."
"Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC) displays distinct visual characteristics on Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images at both low and high resolutions. At low resolution, LUSC often appears as dense, white or light pink regions that contrast with the surrounding normal lung tissue, which may show a more organized structure. These tumor regions can exhibit a more homogeneous texture compared to other lung cancer types. At high resolution, LUSC is characterized by the presence of keratinization, where individual cell keratin or pearl formations can be observed. The malignant cells typically have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and well-defined cell borders. Nuclei are often large, irregularly shaped, and hyperchromatic, with visible nucleoli. Intercellular bridges, a hallmark of squamous differentiation, may also be present. Mitotic figures are commonly seen, indicating active cell proliferation. Additionally, there may be evidence of stromal invasion and associated inflammatory response."
