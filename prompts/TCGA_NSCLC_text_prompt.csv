"A whole slide image of lung adenocarcinoma at low and high resolution reveals irregular tumor regions distorting adjacent structures, smooth or irregular margins indicating invasiveness, and features such as clear cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli, rich vascularity, and cellular heterogeneity."
"A whole slide image of lung squamous cell carcinoma at low and high resolution reveals irregularly shaped solid tumor masses distorting adjacent structures, with features such as squamous cell differentiation, eosinophilic cytoplasm, distinct cell borders, enlarged irregular nuclei, and increased chromatin density."
"A whole slide image of lung adenocarcinoma at low and high resolutions shows irregular shaped tumor regions distorting adjacent structures, with smooth or irregular margins indicating invasiveness, and features like clear cytoplasm, round or oval nuclei, prominent nucleoli, rich vascularity, irregular blood vessels, intratumoral septa, and heterogeneity."
"A whole slide image of lung squamous cell carcinoma at low and high resolution shows irregular solid tumor masses distorting structures, with features like squamous differentiation, abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, distinct borders, enlarged irregular nuclei, and increased chromatin density."
